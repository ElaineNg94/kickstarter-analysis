# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise see how other campaigns compares to each other based on launch date and fundraising goals, since her play, *Fever* did not reach her fundraising goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
**Analysis:** I formed the analysis for the “Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date” chart by making charts and tables. If the percentage and graph points are higher than others, that means it would be more successful or more popular. Simply looking at the numbers alone would not work in this situation because all of these sections do not have the same amount, which is why I decided to make and use my charts and tables.

**Challenges:**
There was a part when filling in the "Kickstarter" sheet where I got confused. My numbers were not showing up properly since it had a “divide by zero error.” I overcame this issue by reading the info box on the side and realized that I can use the INFERROR function to ignore the error. 
Another challenge was when I had to write a big function because I had trouble completing it without getting an error. My original plan was to go to the "Kickstarter" sheet and write my function all at once, but that was giving me issues before I was done writing out my whole function and it caused me to start over. I realized I could keep clicking back and forth at the "Kickstarter" and “Outcomes Based on Goal” sheet to write my function. I overcame this issue by slowly going back and forth from different sheets and ending my function with a parenthesis after each section of my function until I finished writing it.
The last challenge I had was a small issue. When making my charts, I kept forgetting where the “Add Chart Element” section was to add a title to the chart. I realized the reason why I was having problems was because I had to click on my chart first, then click on “Design” at the top bar, and lastly click “Add Chart Element” and “Chart Title.” I overcame this issue by reminding myself I need to click on the whole chart before I can edit or add designs to it.

## Results
#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?

My conclusions of Louise's campaign is that the theater plays launched in the month of May are most successful, while the theater plays launched in are December are the least successful. This means Louise would have a better chance of a successful play and reach her goal if she launched it in the month of May. Launching her play in May would be more likely to be successful because…It would not be a good idea to launch a play in December.
My “Successful” line peaked and reached its highest point in May with 111 out of 166 “successful” plays, while that line was least successful in December with only 37 successful plays out of 75. For the “Outcomes Based on Goals” chart, the goals ranged from less than 1000 to goals of greater than 50,000. On this chart, it shows the “successful” line reached its highest percent value when the goal was “less than 1000,” since 141 out of 186 total projects.

#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

From the Outcomes Based on Goals sheet, I would conclude that the goals of “less than 1000” are most successful, while having bigger goals of 45,000 to 49,999 would make it more likely to be least successful. I can also conclude the number of projects made can have a factor in the percentage of successful, failed, and cancelled because having less projects made can impact your percentage in a big way, such as the one with only one project made. Because of the data we have, it seems like the goals with the least amount are the most successful.

#### What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations of this dataset are is the country is not filtered, so this dataset and charts includes all countries and not just the US. Maybe plays are not as popular in the US compared to other countries so the successfulness could be different if we looked at the US alone. Another limitation is the currency type is not all the same so that can affect the actual goal, average donation, and pledged amount because we do not know if the currency from other countries was converted. 
Another limitation could be that the names and blurbs of the plays are not all in the same language so that could have affected the successfulness in those plays. Some people cannot read in the language they put the blurb in, so that can affect the popularity.
Another limitation could be the number of projects made per goal. When looking at these datasets, I noticed some goals have made more projects than other goals. This made it seem unfair because one failed project can have a huge impact on the percent if that goal range did not have a lot of projects. A more accurate way would be to have an equal number of projects per goal to compare what fundraising goal amount is best.

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

I think other possible tables or graphs we could create would be clustered column charts. I feel a clustered column chart could help us compare the data from the “successful,” “failed,” and “cancelled” categories each month better. The x-axis would have the months, while the y-axis has the number. In a clustered column chart, the columns for each category would be next to each other, so it would be easier to compare the difference per month.
